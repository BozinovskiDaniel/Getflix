This is a going to be a clone of the Netflix Website's Frontpage.

Going to call this project "Getflix"
Has the same front page as Netflix -> When a user signs in or clicks on the free trial, it will take them to a separate page where it will display all relevant movies and tv shows with categories, etc that are being fetched from a movies API.

This project has involved:
- HTML
- CSS
- Javscript
- Bootstrap
- JQuery
